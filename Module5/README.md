<H2>Agent-based consumer population model for research tasks, <br>forecasting and working out scenarios</H2>
<P align=JUSTIFY>The model is intended to study the influence of external circumstances, advertising recommendations and management decisions on the consumer behavior of agents individually, various social groups and the population as a whole, as well as for training and testing recommender systems.</P>
<P align=JUSTIFY>The development includes a consumer model with customizable individual characteristics, a model of the external environment that allows for setting scenarios and includes recommendations from the system under study, a set of examples of creating a population and implementing scenario modeling.</P>
<P align=JUSTIFY>The input is real world data or a given scenario of crisis events or management impacts;</P>
<P align=JUSTIFY>The output is simulated transactions of individual agents and their aggregations in the area of consumer interest, in groups of agents and in the population as a whole, allowing one to make forecasts of consumer behavior under various variants of external factors or to judge the effectiveness of recommendations or management decisions.</P>
